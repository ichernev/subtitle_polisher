          --split
              Propose split locations.
              Sometimes a large file should be edited by several people.
              A good split of the file is when each chunk has approximately
              the same length and there is a reasonable time gap between the
              chunks.
          --from HH:MM:SS,DDD
              Specify the begining of the interval to be examined.
              Must match exactly the start time of a subtitle.
          --to HH:MM:SS,DDD
              Specify the end of the interval to be examined.
              Must match exactly the end time of a subtitle.
          --check-text-length
              List subtitles that have too many charactes.
          --check-timing
              List subtitles that have a high character per second ratio or
              have short duration.
          --fix-timing
              Prolongs subtitles that are considered to have a short duration
              in --check-timing.
          --inplace
              Overwrite original file.
          --output filename
              Specify an output file name.
              The default is the input file name prefixed by 'fixed.'
          --crop
